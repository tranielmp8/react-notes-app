Step #1 - Install JSON Server
To install JSON Server in your application, navigate to your project directory in your terminal or command prompt and type in this command: npm install -g json-server.

This will install the JSON server globally on your system. If you want to install it locally for just a particular project instead, use this command: npm i json-server.

Step #2 - Create a JSON File
Create a JSON file in your project directory that will act as the data source. This JSON file should have a .json file extension. What do I mean? Let's say you want your JSON file name to be 'db', it means you'll create a file called db.json.

Step #3 - Create Data
Define your data inside the JSON file. This JSON data can be an array of objects or an object with nested objects. Each object represents a data entity and should each have a unique id. json example below(
    {
    "notes": [
        {
            "title": "FIRST TITLE",
            "description": "first body of information",
            "id": 1
        },
        {
            "title": "second TITLE",
            "description": "second body of information",
            "id": 2
        },
        {
            "title": "third TITLE",
            "description": "third body of information",
            "id": 3
        }
    ]
}

)

Step #4 - Start the Server
Start up the JSON Server by typing this command into your terminal: json-server --watch db.json. This will run on "https://localhost:3000" by default. You can change the port it's running on by specifying a different port number when starting the server using the --port flag.

For example, if you want your server to run on port 8000 instead of the default (3000), use this command while starting the server: json-server --watch db.json --port 8000. You can then view this in your browser on port 8000.
